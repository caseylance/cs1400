	//	a.  Formula: π*(radius*radius)
	//5.  Calulate and store the value of the area of the square formed by the radii of the four circles.
	//	a.  Formula:  (2*radius)*(2*radius)
	//6.  Store the difference between the value of the area of the square and the value of the area of the circle.
	//7.  Display value from #6 to the user.
	//8.  Keep window open until user hits enter.
